# Paymo MCP Server

A Model Context Protocol (MCP) server for [Paymo](https://www.paymoapp.com/) time tracking and invoicing. Enables Claude Code to manage time entries, projects, tasks, and generate invoice timesheets.

## Features

- ✅ **Time Entry Management**: Create and manage time entries via natural language
- ✅ **Project & Task Discovery**: List and search projects/tasks by name
- ✅ **Invoice Timesheet Export**: Generate CSV timesheets for specific invoices
- ✅ **Invoice Creation** (`create_paymo_invoice`): Roll a project's unbilled entries into a Paymo invoice, grouped by task, with a `dry_run` preview and automatic entry↔invoice-item linkage
- ✅ **Invoice Updates** (`update_paymo_invoice`): Edit status, dates, header/footer text, or project association on an existing invoice
- ✅ **Clickable Dropbox Footer Links** (`generate_invoice_footer_with_share_links`): Mint Dropbox share URLs for timesheet/CSV files and splice a clickable "Timesheet Documentation" block into an invoice's footer (idempotent, preserves existing bank-routing block)
- ⚠️ **Invoice Send Preview** (`preview_paymo_invoice_send`): Paymo's REST API has **no send endpoint** — sending must happen through the Paymo web UI. This tool returns everything needed to eyeball an invoice (recipient, amount, PDF link, warnings) before clicking Send in the web app
- ✅ **Glimpse / Keystone CSV Export** (`export_glimpse_timesheet`): Emit the exact `Date, Duration Hours, Comment, Project Code, Billable` template that Keystone matters submit through the Glimpse portal
- ✅ **Unbilled Time Analysis**: Track unbilled hours and revenue
- ✅ **Batch Operations**: Submit multiple entries from YAML format
- ✅ **Smart Filtering**: Filter entries by project, date range, billing status
- ✅ **Chronological Sorting**: All exports automatically sorted by date

## Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/feamster/paymo-mcp.git
cd paymo-mcp
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Requirements

- Python 3.8+
- Paymo account with API access
- [fastmcp](https://github.com/jlowin/fastmcp) for MCP server functionality

## Configuration

Configuration is split between non-sensitive settings and auth:

**`~/.mcp-config/paymo/config.json`** (non-sensitive, can be in dotfiles):
```json
{
  "timezone": "America/Chicago",
  "defaults": {
    "task_id": null,
    "hours": 8,
    "description": "Development"
  },
  "projects": {
    "Client Matter Name": {
      "project_id": 12345,
      "task_id": 67890
    }
  }
}
```

`timezone` is used for start/end-time entries and for "today". `defaults` (optional) supplies the task, hours per day and description for `add_paymo_time` and the hours target for `get_paymo_time_status`.

**`~/.mcp-auth/paymo/auth.json`** (sensitive, sync separately):
```json
{
  "api_key": "your-paymo-api-key-here"
}
```

**`~/.mcp-auth/dropbox/auth.json`** (only needed for `generate_invoice_footer_with_share_links`):
```json
{
  "app_key": "your-dropbox-app-key",
  "app_secret": "your-dropbox-app-secret",
  "refresh_token": "your-long-lived-refresh-token",
  "scope": "account_info.read files.metadata.read sharing.read sharing.write"
}
```

Recommended: put these files under a cloud-synced folder (e.g. `~/Library/CloudStorage/Box-Box/mcp-auth/`) and symlink `~/.mcp-auth/paymo` and `~/.mcp-auth/dropbox` to that location so credentials sync across machines. `chmod 600` on the JSON files.

### Getting Your Paymo API Key

1. Log into Paymo
2. Go to Settings → API
3. Generate a new API key
4. Copy the key to your config file

### Getting Dropbox OAuth Credentials

The Dropbox integration uses the refresh-token flow — one browser authorization lasts indefinitely (short-lived `sl.*` tokens are auto-renewed by the SDK). Setup:

1. Create an app at <https://www.dropbox.com/developers/apps>: **Scoped access**, **Full Dropbox** (or **App folder** if you only need one folder), give it a name.
2. Under **Permissions**, enable: `account_info.read`, `files.metadata.read`, `sharing.read`, `sharing.write`. Submit.
3. Under **Settings**, copy the **App key** and **App secret**.
4. Visit the authorize URL (replace `<APP_KEY>`):
   ```
   https://www.dropbox.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=<APP_KEY>&response_type=code&token_access_type=offline
   ```
   Click **Allow**, copy the authorization code.
5. Exchange the code for a refresh token:
   ```bash
   curl https://api.dropboxapi.com/oauth2/token \
     -d code=<CODE> \
     -d grant_type=authorization_code \
     -u <APP_KEY>:<APP_SECRET>
   ```
   The response contains `refresh_token` — save all three (`app_key`, `app_secret`, `refresh_token`) into `~/.mcp-auth/dropbox/auth.json` with the schema shown above.

## MCP Tools Reference

### Project & Task Management

#### `list_paymo_projects()`
List all active Paymo projects.

**Returns:** List of projects with IDs, names, and client information.

#### `list_paymo_tasks(project_id: int)`
List all tasks for a specific project.

**Args:**
- `project_id`: The Paymo project ID

**Returns:** List of tasks with IDs, names, and billing information.

### Time Entry Management

#### `create_paymo_entry(task_id, date, duration_hours, description)`
Create a single time entry.

**Args:**
- `task_id` (int): Task ID to log time against
- `date` (str): Date in YYYY-MM-DD format
- `duration_hours` (float): Hours worked (e.g., 3.5)
- `description` (str): Description of work performed

**Returns:** Created entry details.

**Example:**
```python
create_paymo_entry(
    task_id=31450618,
    date="2025-12-10",
    duration_hours=6.0,
    description="Expert report drafting and analysis"
)
```

#### `submit_paymo_timesheet(yaml_content: str)`
Submit multiple entries from YAML format.

**Args:**
- `yaml_content`: YAML string with timesheet entries

**Returns:** Summary of created entries.

**Example YAML:**
```yaml
matter: "Patent Litigation Matter"
client: "Law Firm Client"
rate: 650

entries:
  - date: "2025-12-02"
    start_time: "09:00"
    end_time: "12:30"
    timezone: "America/Chicago"
    task_id: 31450618
    description: "Case strategy meeting"

  - date: "2025-12-03"
    duration_hours: 5.0
    task_id: 31450740
    description: "Expert witness report preparation"
```

#### `list_paymo_entries(start_date, end_date, project_id=None, billed=None, user_id=None, all_users=False)`
List time entries with optional filters. **Defaults to the API key's own user**: on multi-user Paymo accounts the API returns every entry the key can see, including colleagues'.

**Args:**
- `start_date` (str): Start date (YYYY-MM-DD)
- `end_date` (str): End date (YYYY-MM-DD)
- `project_id` (int, optional): Filter by project
- `billed` (bool, optional): Filter by billing status (True=billed, False=unbilled, None=all)
- `user_id` (int, optional): List another user's entries instead
- `all_users` (bool): Return every visible entry (previous behaviour)

**Returns:** List of entries with user ID, task names, durations, descriptions, and billing status.

#### `get_paymo_current_user()`
Return the Paymo user (id, name) that owns the API key.

#### `add_paymo_time(start_date, end_date=None, task_id=None, hours_per_day=None, description=None, exclude_dates=None, exclude_start=None, exclude_end=None, only_skip_same_task=False, dry_run=True)`
Bulk-add one entry per working day (Mon–Fri) for your own user. **Defaults to a dry run**: nothing is created until called again with `dry_run=False`. Days that already have any of your time logged are skipped, so days are never double-booked and re-running is safe (`only_skip_same_task=True` only skips days with an entry on the same task). Unset arguments fall back to `defaults` in `config.json`.

**Example:**
```python
add_paymo_time(start_date="2026-07-06", end_date="2026-07-10", task_id=32862251,
               exclude_dates=["2026-07-10"])          # preview
add_paymo_time(..., dry_run=False)                    # create after review
```

#### `get_paymo_time_status(start_date=None, end_date=None, target_hours_per_day=None, task_id=None)`
Hours logged vs. target per working day for your own user (defaults to this week, Monday to today). Returns totals, shortfall, `days_under_target` and `last_logged_date`, which is useful for finding missing timesheet days.

### Public holidays

`public_holidays.py` lists New Zealand public holidays plus Auckland Anniversary Day (observed dates for a Mon–Fri worker) from the official Employment New Zealand table, currently to the end of 2027. `observed_dates(start, end)` returns dates ready for `exclude_dates`. Update the table yearly from the source page rather than calculating dates (Easter and Matariki move). Run `python public_holidays.py` to print upcoming holidays.

### Invoice Management

#### `list_paymo_invoices(client_id=None, status=None)`
List Paymo invoices with optional filters.

**Args:**
- `client_id` (int, optional): Filter by client
- `status` (str, optional): Filter by status ("draft", "sent", "viewed", "paid")

**Returns:** List of invoices with numbers, amounts, dates, and statuses.

#### `get_outstanding_invoices_last_week()`
Get outstanding invoices from the last 7 days.

**Returns:** List of recent invoices with status "sent" or "viewed".

#### `update_paymo_invoice(invoice_number, status=None, date=None, due_date=None, notes=None, title=None, bill_to=None, company_info=None, footer=None, currency=None, project_id=None)`
Update fields on an existing Paymo invoice. Pass only the fields you want to change.

**Args:**
- `invoice_number` (str): Invoice number (with or without `#` prefix)
- `status` (str, optional): New status; one of `draft`, `sent`, `viewed`, `paid`, `void`
- `date` / `due_date` (str, optional): YYYY-MM-DD
- `notes`, `title`, `bill_to`, `company_info`, `footer` (str, optional): Header/footer text
- `currency` (str, optional): ISO code (e.g. `USD`)
- `project_id` (int, optional): Paymo project id. Also sets `options.linked_projects` so the web UI Project column stays populated. See troubleshooting for why both are needed.

**Returns:** Trimmed updated invoice dict with `previous_status` and `updated_fields`.

**Common uses:**
- Mark paid after bank reconciliation: `update_paymo_invoice("INV-...", status="paid")`
- Fix an invoice whose Project column renders empty: `update_paymo_invoice("INV-...", project_id=3482327)`

#### `generate_invoice_footer_with_share_links(invoice_number, timesheet_paths, keystone_csv_paths=None, heading="Timesheet Documentation", apply=True)`
Mint Dropbox share URLs for timesheet/CSV files inside `~/Dropbox` and splice a clickable "Timesheet Documentation" block into an invoice's footer. Renders as `<a href>` anchor tags → PDF link annotations in the exported invoice.

**Args:**
- `invoice_number` (str): Invoice number (with or without `#` prefix)
- `timesheet_paths` (List[str]): Absolute paths to files inside `~/Dropbox` (per-project timesheet PDFs/CSVs)
- `keystone_csv_paths` (List[str], optional): Additional CSVs rendered under a subheading (e.g. Keystone Strategy exports)
- `heading` (str): Section heading; default `"Timesheet Documentation"`
- `apply` (bool): If True (default) PUT the new footer to Paymo; if False return the computed footer without updating

**Returns:** `{invoice_number, invoice_id, footer, links: {local_path: share_url}, applied}`

**Behavior:**
- **Idempotent** — subsequent calls replace the block between `<!-- timesheet-links-start -->` / `<!-- timesheet-links-end -->` markers instead of duplicating.
- **Preserves existing footer content** (bank routing block, etc.) by splicing rather than replacing.
- **Reuses existing share links** via `sharing_list_shared_links(direct_only=True)` — safe to call repeatedly, won't create duplicate links.
- Requires `~/.mcp-auth/dropbox/auth.json` (see Configuration).

**Example:**
```python
generate_invoice_footer_with_share_links(
    invoice_number="INV-20260706-123",
    timesheet_paths=[
        "/Users/me/Dropbox/Invoices/2026-07/ClientA_timesheet.pdf",
    ],
    keystone_csv_paths=[
        "/Users/me/Dropbox/Invoices/2026-07/keystone_hours.csv",
    ],
)
```

#### `export_invoice_timesheet(invoice_number: str, strict: bool = True)`
Export a formatted, billing-ready timesheet CSV for a specific invoice. **This is the primary tool for generating invoice timesheets.**

**Args:**
- `invoice_number` (str): The invoice number as shown on the invoice (e.g., "INV-20260331-241")
- `strict` (bool): If True (default), validate that calculated totals match invoice. If False, skip validation.

**Returns:** Formatted CSV content with:
- **Header section**: Matter name, Invoice number, Period, Total Hours, Fees, Expenses, Total Due
- **Data section**: Date, Start Time (HH:MM), End Time (HH:MM), Duration, Task, Description
- **Footer**: Expenses summary

**Features:**
- **Strict matching (default)**: Only includes entries explicitly linked to that invoice via `invoice_item_id`, and validates that calculated fees match invoice totals within 5%
- Chronologically sorted by date (earliest first)
- Clean HH:MM time format (not raw ISO timestamps)
- Billing-ready format with summary header
- 90-day lookback to capture all entries

**Example:**
```python
export_invoice_timesheet("INV-20260331-241")           # strict validation (default)
export_invoice_timesheet("INV-20260331-241", False)    # skip validation
```

**When to use:**
- "Export timesheet for invoice INV-20260331-241"
- "Generate the timesheet for my latest invoice"
- "Get a billing-ready timesheet for invoice X"

**If validation fails:** Use `export_paymo_timesheet(start_date, end_date, project_id)` to export by date range instead.

#### `export_invoice_paymo_format(invoice_number: str, strict: bool = True)`
Export timesheet in **exact Paymo native format** with all standard columns. Use this when you need the export to match Paymo's own export format exactly.

**Args:**
- `invoice_number` (str): The invoice number (e.g., "INV-20260331-241")
- `strict` (bool): If True (default), validate totals match invoice

**Returns:** CSV with exact Paymo columns:
```
User, Internal User Id, Project, Internal Project Id, Project Description,
Tasklist, Internal Tasklist Id, Task, Internal Task Id, Start Time, End Time,
Worked Time, Decimal Hours, Time In Seconds
```

**When to use:**
- Need exact Paymo format for import into another system
- Need all internal IDs (user, project, task, tasklist)
- User explicitly asks for "Paymo format"

**Example:**
```python
export_invoice_paymo_format("INV-20260331-241")
```

#### `export_paymo_timesheet(start_date, end_date, project_id=None, format="csv")`
Export timesheet for a date range.

**Args:**
- `start_date` (str): Start date (YYYY-MM-DD)
- `end_date` (str): End date (YYYY-MM-DD)
- `project_id` (int, optional): Filter by project
- `format` (str): Export format ("csv" or "xls")

**Returns:** Path to exported file.

### Expense Management

#### `list_paymo_expenses(start_date=None, end_date=None, project_id=None, billable_only=False)`
List Paymo expenses, optionally filtered by date range and/or project.

**Args:**
- `start_date` (str, optional): YYYY-MM-DD (inclusive)
- `end_date` (str, optional): YYYY-MM-DD (inclusive)
- `project_id` (int, optional): Restrict to one project/matter
- `billable_only` (bool): If True, return only billable expenses (filtered in Python)

**Returns:** List of trimmed expense dicts (`id`, `project_id`, `client_id`, `name`, `notes`, `date`, `amount`, `currency`, `billable`, `invoiced`, `invoice_item_id`).

**Note on date filtering:** Paymo's server-side `where=date in (...)` clause is *set membership*, not a range, and silently returns wrong results. This tool filters dates in Python; the `project_id` server filter is used when supplied.

**When to use:**
- *"What expenses have I filed on matter X?"*
- *"What was the last expense I created?"* (sort results by `date`/`id` descending)

#### `create_paymo_expense(project_id, name, date, amount, description=None, quantity=1, billable=True, currency="USD")`
Create a single expense on a project/matter.

**Args:**
- `project_id` (int): Paymo project (matter) ID
- `name` (str): Short label, e.g. `"United - DFW deposition travel"`
- `date` (str): YYYY-MM-DD (charge date)
- `amount` (float): Total expense amount (price × quantity)
- `description` (str, optional): Detail (merchant, purpose)
- `quantity` (float): Default 1; `price` is derived as `amount / quantity`
- `billable` (bool): Default True
- `currency` (str): Default `"USD"`

**Returns:** Trimmed created expense dict (`id`, `project_id`, `name`, `date`, `amount`, `billable`).

#### `delete_paymo_expense(expense_id: int)`
Delete an expense by ID. Corrections = delete then recreate.

**Returns:** Status string (`"Successfully deleted expense N"` or a failure message).

#### `audit_paymo_expenses(start_date, end_date, project_id=None)`
Read-only audit over a date range - never writes. Checks:

- **Duplicates** — exact (project+date+amount+name → *error*), near-dupe (amount+name within ±2 days → *warn*)
- **Math integrity** — `abs(price - amount) > 0.01` → *error*; amount ≤ 0 → *warn*; non-USD → *warn*. (Paymo does not persist `quantity`, so unit expenses have `price == amount`.)
- **Matter-mapping sanity** — expense's project has zero hours in date ±1 window, or a different project dominated → *warn*
- **Billing hygiene** — billable + uninvoiced but matter has a later invoice → *info*; `invoiced=true` with no `invoice_item_id` link → *warn*

**Returns:** `{range, counts, totals_by_matter, findings}`. Fixes are executed by the caller via `delete_paymo_expense` + `create_paymo_expense`.

## Example Queries (via Claude Desktop)

### Time Entry Creation

- *"Create a 3.5 hour entry for the Patent Litigation project on Dec 10 for prior art research"*
- *"Log 6 hours today on expert report drafting for the IP case"*
- *"Add a 2 hour call entry for yesterday on the litigation support task"*

### Project & Invoice Discovery

- *"List all my active projects"*
- *"Show me tasks for the Corporate Advisory project"*
- *"What invoices do I have outstanding from last week?"*
- *"List all unpaid invoices for Client XYZ"*

### Analytical Queries

- *"How much unbilled time do I have in the last 30 days?"*
- *"Which projects haven't had an invoice in the last month?"*
- *"Show me unbilled hours for the Patent Litigation project"*
- *"What's my total billed revenue for November 2025?"*
- *"Calculate my unbilled revenue by project for Q4"*

### Timesheet Export

- *"Export the timesheet for invoice INV-20260331-241"*
- *"Generate timesheet for my latest DivX invoice"*
- *"Export timesheets for all outstanding invoices from last week"*
- *"Generate a CSV of my December time entries"*

## Example Output

### Invoice Timesheet Export

When you run `export_invoice_timesheet("INV-20260331-241")`, you get a billing-ready CSV:

```csv
Matter,DivX vs. Netflix
Invoice,INV-20260331-241
Period,2026-03-04 to 2026-03-25
Total Hours,239.01
Fees,$143406.00
Expenses,$1016.95
Total Due,$144422.95

Date,Start Time,End Time,Duration (hours),Task,Description
2026-03-04,09:00,10:30,1.50,Trial Prep,Trial prep
2026-03-04,11:00,13:00,2.00,Trial Prep,"Post outline review session: incorporated feedback on outline flow"
2026-03-06,01:00,04:00,3.00,Trial Prep,"Solo trial prep: reviewing patent materials and invalidity case outline"
2026-03-06,16:00,17:30,1.50,Trial Prep,"Trial prep run-through with counsel re: patent technical benefits section"

Expenses,$1016.95
```

**Key features:**
- Header with Matter, Invoice, Period, Total Hours, Fees, Expenses, Total Due
- Times in clean HH:MM format (not raw ISO timestamps)
- Entries sorted chronologically by date
- Footer with expenses

### Unbilled Time Analysis

When you ask *"How much unbilled time do I have?"*, Claude might respond:

```
You have 47.5 unbilled hours across 3 projects:

Patent Litigation Matter: 30.75 hours ($19,987.50)
Corporate Advisory: 12.00 hours ($7,800.00)
Expert Witness Case: 4.75 hours ($3,087.50)

Total unbilled: $30,875.00
```

## How It Works

### Natural Language to API Calls

The MCP server enables Claude to automatically translate natural language to Paymo API calls:

**You say:** *"Create a 6 hour entry for the litigation project on Dec 10"*

**Claude automatically:**
1. Calls `list_paymo_projects()` to find projects
2. Searches for "litigation" in project names
3. Calls `list_paymo_tasks(project_id)` to get tasks
4. Creates the entry with `create_paymo_entry()`

**You say:** *"Which projects have unbilled time?"*

**Claude automatically:**
1. Calls `list_paymo_projects()` to get all projects
2. For each project, calls `list_paymo_entries()` with `billed=False`
3. Aggregates and reports unbilled hours by project

### Invoice-Specific Exports

The `export_invoice_timesheet()` function provides billing-ready timesheets with **strict validation**:

1. Finds invoice by number (e.g., "INV-20260331-241")
2. Retrieves invoice and its line items
3. Finds all time entries linked to those invoice items (via `invoice_item_id`)
4. **Validates totals**: Checks that (hours × rate) matches invoice total within 5%
5. Looks back 90 days to catch all entries (handles monthly billing cycles)
6. Fetches task names and project/matter name
7. Sorts entries chronologically by date (earliest first)
8. Generates formatted CSV with:
   - Header: Matter, Invoice, Period, Total Hours, Fees, Expenses, Total Due
   - Data: Date, Start Time (HH:MM), End Time (HH:MM), Duration, Task, Description
   - Footer: Expenses summary

This ensures you get **only** the entries actually billed on that specific invoice, with validation that the totals match.

**Alternative - Date Range Export:**
If you need entries by date range regardless of invoice linkage (or if strict validation fails), use `export_paymo_timesheet(start_date, end_date, project_id)` instead.

## Rate Limiting

The script automatically handles Paymo's API rate limits:

- Monitors `X-Ratelimit-Remaining` headers
- Adds 2-second delays between task lookups
- Retries on 429 errors with exponential backoff
- Displays warnings when approaching limits

## Troubleshooting

### "API key not configured"

Create `~/.mcp-auth/paymo/auth.json` with your API key (see Configuration section).

### "fastmcp not installed"

The server imports `mcp.server.fastmcp` from the official `mcp` package (Python 3.10+). Install the 1.x line; `mcp` 2.x changed its layout and currently fails to import here:
```bash
pip install "mcp>=1.2,<2"
```

### Entries missing at the start or end of a date range

Paymo matches `time_interval` in UTC, so in timezones far from UTC (e.g. New Zealand, UTC+12) entries on the first or last day of a range could be dropped. `get_entries` now queries one extra day either side and filters on each entry's own `date`.

### "Rate limit exceeded"

The script will automatically wait and retry. If you see this frequently, reduce batch operation sizes.

### Empty invoice exports

Some invoices may not have time entries (flat fee or expense-only invoices). Verify the invoice includes time entries in Paymo.

### Invoice "Project" column is empty in the Paymo web UI

Paymo invoices have **two** fields for project association:

1. `project_id` (top-level) — the canonical link; reports and analytics use this.
2. `options.linked_projects: [{amount, project_id}]` — what the **web UI Project column** actually renders.

If you set only `project_id`, the Project column in the invoices list view is empty and clients see something that looks broken. `create_paymo_invoice` wires both automatically. When patching an invoice built by another tool, use `update_paymo_invoice(invoice_number, project_id=...)` — it sets both.

### Dropbox: `DropboxAuthError: Dropbox auth not found`

`generate_invoice_footer_with_share_links` needs `~/.mcp-auth/dropbox/auth.json` with `app_key`, `app_secret`, and `refresh_token`. See the "Getting Dropbox OAuth Credentials" section under Configuration for setup.

### Dropbox: `expired_access_token` or `invalid_access_token`

The SDK is initialized with the long-lived refresh token and mints short-lived access tokens on demand — you should not see this. If you do, your refresh token was revoked (Dropbox admin action or you removed the app). Re-run the OAuth setup and overwrite `refresh_token` in the auth file.

### Key Classes

- **`PaymoClient`**: API wrapper with rate limiting and retry logic
- **`TimesheetProcessor`**: YAML parsing and batch entry creation

### Adding New MCP Tools

1. Add the `@mcp.tool()` decorator
2. Define clear docstrings with arg descriptions
3. Load config and create PaymoClient
4. Return structured data (dicts/lists, not strings)

Example:
```python
@mcp.tool()
def my_new_tool(arg1: str, arg2: int) -> Dict[str, Any]:
    """
    Brief description of what this tool does

    Args:
        arg1: Description of first argument
        arg2: Description of second argument

    Returns:
        Description of return value
    """
    config = load_config()
    api_key = config.get('api_key')
    client = PaymoClient(api_key)

    # Implementation here
    return {"result": "data"}
```
